#   # The color_dark, background_image_dark, image_dark, branding_dark are parameters that set the background
#   # and image when the device is in dark mode. If they are not specified, the app will use the
#   # parameters from above. If the image_dark parameter is specified, color_dark or
#   # background_image_dark must be specified.  color_dark and background_image_dark cannot both be
#   # set.
#   color_dark: "#000000"

#   # Android 12 handles the splash screen differently than previous versions.  Please visit
